# Comparative Genomics of E. coli K-12 MG1655 and Campylobacter coli
This repository contains an R Markdown workflow for comparative genomics analysis between Escherichia coli K-12 MG1655 and Campylobacter coli (GCA_003780985).
The analysis explores differences in coding sequence metrics, base composition, codon usage bias, amino acid frequencies, and k-mer distributions.
The reference genome sequences used in this analysis were obtained from Ghazanfar Khan.

# The analysis explores:

- Coding sequence metrics

- Base composition

- Codon usage bias (RSCU)

- Amino acid frequencies

- Protein k-mer distributions (k=3â€“5)

# Features

1. CDS Analysis: Counts, coding capacity, length distributions

2. Base Composition: Genome-wide nucleotide frequencies (A, T, G, C)

3. Codon Usage and RSCU: Synonymous codon bias and preferences

4. Amino Acid Frequencies: Distribution across all proteins

5. K-mer Analysis: Over-/under-represented motifs

Comparative Figures and Tables: Boxplots, barplots, codon usage tables
